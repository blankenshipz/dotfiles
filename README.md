# blankenshipz dotfiles

[holman dotifiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)

The main difference so far from holman dotfiles is a focus on vim with the addition of a set of vim plugin submodules

#### Install

Run this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blankenshipz/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```
This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory. Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.
